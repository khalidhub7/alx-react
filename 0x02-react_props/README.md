# React Props

A simple project to learn and practice **React props** and component patterns.

## Learning Objectives

- How to create basic React components using functions
- How to reuse components
- How to pass properties to components
- How to define types for components
- How to use Fragments
- When to use a key to improve a loopâ€™s performance

> Hint: The task says to work with Enzyme for tests, but I used React Testing Library (RTL) because Enzyme is deprecated and requires older Node.js, older Webpack, and older React.
