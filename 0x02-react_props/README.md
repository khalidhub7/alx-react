# React Props

A simple project to learn and practice **React props** and component patterns.

## Learning Objectives

- How to create basic React components using functions
- How to reuse components
- How to pass properties to components
- How to define types for components
- How to use Fragments
- When to use a key to improve a loop’s performance

> **Hint:** The original task mentioned using Enzyme for testing, but since Enzyme is deprecated and depends on older versions of Node.js, Webpack, and React, I used **React Testing Library (RTL)** instead.  
> If you want to learn about Enzyme’s `shallow` rendering, check the docs: [Enzyme Shallow Rendering](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/docs/api/shallow.html)
