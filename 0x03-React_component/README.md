# React Component ⚛️

A simple learning project to understand how React components work — from function vs class components to testing, optimization, and advanced concepts like HOCs.

---

## Learning Objectives 🎯

- When to use a **Class** or a **Function** to create a component
- The **lifecycle** of a Class component
- How to **test a component** 🧪
- How to use a **Jest spy** to verify function calls 👀
- What an **HOC (Higher-Order Component)** is and how to use it
- How to **optimize performance** ⚡ and control which components render

---

## Project Structure 📂

This project contains folders `task_0` to `task_5`:  

- `task_0` to `task_4`: Each folder contains only the updated files relevant to that task.  
  - **Aim:** Reduce the size of each folder so you can focus only on the files that changed.  
- `task_5`: Contains all the project files combined — a full working version of the project ✅
