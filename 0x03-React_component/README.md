# React Component

A simple learning project to understand how React components work — from function vs class components to testing, optimization, and advanced concepts like HOCs.

---

## Learning Objectives

- When to use a **Class** or a **Function** to create a component  
- The **lifecycle** of a Class component  
- How to **test a component**  
- How to use a **Jest spy** to verify function calls  
- What an **HOC (Higher-Order Component)** is and how to use it  
- How to **optimize performance** and control which components render

## Topics Overview

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| Function Components | Modern, hook-based, and easy to manage |
| Class Components | Ideal for lifecycle control and stateful logic |
| Lifecycle Methods | Understand mounting, updating, and unmounting phases |
| Testing | Use Jest and React Testing Library for validation |
| Jest Spies | Track and verify function calls |
| HOCs | Reuse logic by wrapping components |
| Optimization | Prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve speed |
