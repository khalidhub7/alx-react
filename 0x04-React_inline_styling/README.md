# React Inline Styling 🎨

A hands-on project to learn styling React components using CSS files, inline styles, and CSS-in-JS, with responsive design and basic animations.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

- Understand the differences between using a **CSS file** and **inline styling**
- Learn how to use a **CSS-in-JS tool** like Aphrodite
- Apply **conditional styles** dynamically using JavaScript
- Implement **responsive design** to adapt the UI for different screen sizes
- Create **small animations** within your React components

## Project Structure 📂

This project builds on the last task of the **React Component** project:

- **task_0 to task_3**: Only updated files for each task — learn one styling concept at a time.
- **task_4**: Full revised version of the project with all styling approaches applied ✅

### Hints

**Task 1 – Aphrodite Styling**  
Aphrodite is only used for the footer component. Applying it across the entire project would be harder to maintain, so it’s kept limited to one component.

**Task 2 – Conditional Styling**  
The goal of this task is to apply conditional styles across the whole project. However, for simplicity and maintainability, conditional styles are applied only in `NotificationItem.js` to distinguish between urgent and default notifications.
