# React Inline Styling 🎨

A hands-on project to learn styling React components using CSS files, inline styles, and CSS-in-JS, with responsive design and basic animations.

## Learning Objectives 🎯

- Understand the differences between using a **CSS file** and **inline styling**  
- Learn how to use a **CSS-in-JS tool** like Aphrodite  
- Apply **conditional styles** dynamically using JavaScript  
- Implement **responsive design** to adapt the UI for different screen sizes  
- Create **small animations** within your React components  

## Project Structure 📂

- **task_5**: Full revised version of the project with all styling approaches applied ✅
