# Webpack Practice

A simple project to learn and practice **Webpack** basics.

## Learning Objectives

- How to setup Webpack for a basic project
- Entry points, output, and loaders
- How to add plugins
- How to split your code into chunks
- How to setup a dev server

## Steps

1. **Entry**
   - Define the entry point (e.g., `src/index.js`).

2. **Output**
   - Configure where bundled files go (e.g., `dist/main.js`).

3. **Loaders**
   - Tell Webpack how to handle files (e.g., Babel for JS, CSS loader for styles).

4. **Plugins**
   - Add extra features (e.g., `HtmlWebpackPlugin` to generate HTML, `CleanWebpackPlugin` to clear `dist`).
